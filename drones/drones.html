          <h1>AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY</h1>
    </header>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sustainable energy is the prime driver and key enabler of sustainable 
    
development.<br /> The sector holds high significance in terms of development

challenges and environmental impacts such as climate change. <br />However, long-term

sustainable energy security for all remains a concern for developed and for

developing countries even though the challenges may vary with regard to

geography, economic capacities and requirements and other relevant parameters.</p>
    
    <h2>Techno-energy boost</h2>
    <img src="ecno.jpg
    ">
    <p> Sub-Saharan Africa's lack of electricity is hindering development

but this can be reversed if countries turn to ambitious, large-

scale renewable energy projects, an environmental thinktank

suggests.

<br />The region faces an energy crisis that development models are not

addressing, according to a report by the Green Alliance.

"Even with robust economic growth, [the region's] existing energy

infrastructure is a brake on progress.<br /> With population growth

continuing to outstrip electrification, the number of people

without energy access is only projected to grow," say the

authors. "This has significant implications for development, with

impacts on health, education and household economy.

<br />Disproportionate amounts of time and income are spent securing

energy by other means, such as gathering wood, which also has

detrimental impacts on the natural environment.

"Low carbon, decentralised energy can reach communities much

faster than expanding existing, inefficient central grid systems.

And it offers immediate improvements to people's lives.

<br />Projections for achieving universal energy access in sub­Saharan

Africa acknowledge this potential and assume that just over half

the provision will need to be mini and off­grid solutions. Such

options will also be more resilient in the face of climate

changes."</p>

<h2>substanial increase of reneweable energy</h2>

<p>
1. Efficient use of energy reduces the need for power generation

and thus the need for cooling water. Water efficiency

is also energy efficiency: using water more efficiently can

cut electricity consumption, as lower water demand reduces

the need for pumping and treating water. Exploring

the co-benefits of water saving tied to energy efficiency,

as well as the potential to save energy through water efficiency,

can thus help secure additional benefits.

<br />2.The deployment of wind technologies has grown since 2005 with

the result that governments and the private sector have recognised

its value. Examples of successful wind deployment include

110 MW installed in Ethiopia, 10 MW in Kenya with 500 MW in

the pipeline and 50-100 MW of wind in the pipeline in Tanzania,

Several wind projects in MENA countries as well as several successful

bidding rounds in South Africa are also underway. The

on-grid renewables development in SSA has been largely driven

by FITs coupled with an increase in demand for electricity and

the decreasing cost of wind technology

<br />3.Grid-connected solar PV and wind power have established themselves

as the lowest cost renewable energy options for Australia.

In Australia, 75% of the population wants more renewable energy

demonstrating an inherent understanding of the importance of

renewable energies.</p>
  
 <h2>universal access to modern affordable energy</h2> 
 <img src="ensure.jpg">
 <p>Business can accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable and

sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy

resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy

technologies and infrastructure.<br /> Also, with investment in

R&D, businesses can innovate and pioneer new technologies that change the status

quo of the global energy system, becoming the

center of climate change solutions.

<br />1.Ensure that all employees and their families have access to a reliable and

affordable source of energy by investing in local

infrastructure to establish accessible energy services.

<br />2 Commit to sourcing 100% of operational electricity needs from renewable

sources.

<br />3 Reduce the internal demand for transport by prioritizing telecommunications

and incentivize less energy intensive modes such

as train travel over auto and air travel.

<br />4 Invest in R&D related to sustainable energy services, bringing new

technologies to the market quickly.

<br />5 Integrate renewable energy into employee benefits packages, subsidizing the

capital expenditures associated with residential

solar or electric vehicle investments.

<br />6 As women typically drive much of the energy consumption at the household

level, companies have an opportunity to invest and

train women to become renewable energy entrepreneurs.

<br />7Prioritize energy efficiency across operations through tools such as the use of

an internal carbon price and science-based target

setting to reduce overall demand for energy.</p>
    
    <h2>enhancement of clean energy</h2>
    <img src="clean.jpg">
    <p>The Global Goals also aim to double the rate of improvement in energy

efficiency. Climate Works Australia estimates that “improving the energy

efficiency of Australia’s commercial buildings could save $2.3 billion per year

across the national economy while cutting emissions by 23 million tonnes per

year.” <br />Climate Works Australia also estimates that “purchasing high efficiency

appliances at the time of natural replacement can cut [Australian] household

energy bills by $471 million per year while saving over 2 million tonnes of

emissions per year.<br />

        
        <p><b>How do we achieve all this?</b></p>

<p>We must enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy

research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and

advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology as well as promote investment in

energy infrastructure and clean energy technology. <br />This investment must lead to

an expansion in infrastructure as well as an upgrade of the technology.

We must also focus on our Indo-Pacific neighbours, in particular, least

developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing

countries. Many people in these countries don’t have access to affordable energy

services. <br />The small island developing States are also at risk of being submerged

by rising sea levels if we do not reduce carbon emissions to reverse the impacts

of global warming by 2030.</p>
